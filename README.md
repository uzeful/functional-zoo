Model definitions and pretrained weights for PyTorch and Tensorflow

PyTorch, unlike lua torch, has autograd in it's core, so using modular
structure of `torch.nn` modules is not necessary, one can easily allocate
needed Variables and write a function that utilizes them, which is sometimes
more convenient. This repo contains model definitions in this functional way,
with pretrained weights for some models.

Weights are serialized as a dict of arrays in `hdf5`, so should be easily
loadable in other frameworks. Thanks to @edgarriba we have [cpp_parser](cpp_parser) for
loading weights in C++.

More models coming! We also plan to add definitions for other frameworks
in future, probably `tiny-dnn` first. Contributions are welcome.

## Models

All models were validated to produce reported accuracy using
[imagenet-validation.py](imagenet-validation.py) script (depends on
OpenCV python bindings).

To load weights in Python first do `pip install hickle`, then:

```python
import hickle as hkl
weights = hkl.load('resnet-18-export.hkl')
```

Unfortunately, hickle py3 support is not yet ready, so the models will be resaved in torch pickle format with `torch.utils.model_zoo.load_url` support, e.g.:

```python
weights = model_zoo.load_url('https://s3.amazonaws.com/modelzoo-networks/wide-resnet-50-2-export-5ae25d50.pth')
```

Also, `make_dot` was moved to a separate package: [PyTorchViz](https://github.com/szagoruyko/pytorchviz)

### Folded

Models below have batch_norm parameters and statistics folded into convolutional
layers for speed. It is not recommended to use them for finetuning.
